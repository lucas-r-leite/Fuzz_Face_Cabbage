<h1>Fuzz Face - Fuzz-style distortion effect for Cabbage</h1>

This code implements a Fuzz Face-style distortion effect for Cabbage, a real-time audio development environment based on a programming language.

The effect is created using two sliders, one to control the amount of fuzz distortion and another to adjust the output level. The fuzz slider allows you to adjust the intensity of the distortion, while the volume slider allows you to adjust the output level of the processed signal.

The code is organized in a .csd file that contains an instrument and a score. The instrument (instr 1) is responsible for processing the input signal and applying the fuzz distortion. The score is responsible for starting the instrument and running it for a specified period of time.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

To run the code, you need to have Cabbage and Csound installed on your computer. Cabbage is a real-time audio development environment based on a programming language, while Csound is an audio synthesis programming language.

<strong>How to use </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Cabbage and run the .csd file</li>
        <li>Use the "Fuzz" and "Out" sliders to adjust the amount of distortion and the output level, respectively.</li>
        <li>Apply the fuzz distortion effect to your audio signal.</li>
    </ul>
